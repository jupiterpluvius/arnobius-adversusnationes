**1.39 Translation**
1. O blindness, not long ago I venerated images just made from furnaces, gods made on anvils and with hammers, the bones of elephants, paintings, ribbons on ancient trees; whenever I had looked at a slippery stone, wet with olive oil, as if a power were present inside it, I used to worship it, I used to speak to it and I used to request favors from the unfeeling trunk, and those gods themselves, whom I had persuaded myself were real, I used to affix with serious slanders, when I believed that they were sticks, stones, and bones or resided in those materials.
2. Now, led by such a *teacher* into the ways of truth, I know all *these* things which are, I feel worthy feelings about worthy things, I make no complaint to the divine name, and what and to whom something is owed each person or head, I offer it, with unconfused gradations and distinctions.
3. So therefore should Christ not be held as a god by us and not otherwise maintained with worship of his godliness, for each who is able, from whom this long time we both receive such wonderful gifts, living, and we await the day when he will come?

**Jerome's References Translation**
1. Arnobius, a rhetorician, is held in high esteem in Africa, who, while he taught young men in Sicca to make speeches, and as yet was a pagan was compelled to *credulitas* in dreams, and was not granted, by a bishop, the faith which always he had fought against, he composed at night against his former religion most excellent books and together, as if with certain pledges, he entered the faith which he had sought.
2. Arnobius, under Emperor Diocletian, most prosperously taught rhetoric at Sicca in Africa, and wrote books against the pagans, which generally circulate... Firmianus and Lactantius were students of Arnobius... here in extreme old age he was the teacher of Caesar Crispus, son of Constantine, in Gaul...
3. Arnobius is uneven and excessive and, were it not for the distribution of his work, obscure.
4. I decide now and then to read Origen, thus because of his instruction, just as Tertullian and Novatus, Arnobius and Apollinarius, and some Church writers, the Greeks and the Latin-speakers equally, so that we may choose the good things of theirs, and avoid certain things, as the apostle Paul says: examine all things, and accept those which are good.
5. Arnobius distributed seven books against the pagans and his disciple Lactantius did the same.

**Persecutions (2.76-78) Translation**
76.1. "Why therefore," he says, "if you all serve the omnipotent God, and believe that he finds concern in your health and wellbeing, why does he allow you all to suffer such persecutions and endure all sorts of punishments and supplications?"
76.2 Let us, conversely, search everywhere, and ask why you, although you worship so many innumerable gods and although you build sacred temples to them, you mold statues of them from gold, you sacrifice flocks of animals, you throw all incense boxes of frankincense on full altars, why do you all not receive exemptions from so many crises and storms, from which daily you all live in many and deadly examples of your fortune?
76.3 Why, I say, do your gods cease to avert so many kinds of diseases and illnesses from you, shipwrecks, downfalls, fires, pestilences, sterility, loss of pledges and confiscation of goods, instances of discord, wars, rivalries, the capturing of cities and enslavements with your status and rights taken away?
76.4 But also God does not aid us in misfortunes of this sort. The reason is visible and clear. For nothing is promised to us in regard to this life, nor is any aid pledged or granted to us for those on earth of health in this sack of flesh; indeed we have been taught to think and to deem all threats of fortune, whatever they are, of little import, and if at any time some more grave force will have threatened us, and this must come to an end, to find pleasure in the misfortune and neither to fear nor flee, because more easily we are able to remove the bondages of the body from its chains and to destroy the shadowy blindness.

77.1 And so that which you say is the roughness of persecution is our freedom, not persecution, nor will upheaval inflict punishment, but will lead us to the light of freedom.
77.2 It is as if some brutish and dull man should reckon a man, put in prison, without a departure, never to afflict himself with heavy and burdensome punishments of investigations, unless he attacks the prison itself, he smashes the wood and burns the roof and the wall, he strips, hurls, and destroys the doors and other parts of the place, not knowing, with this done, for him to whom it seemed that he impeded light, it was being given by him, and sinful blindness was being taken away by him: likewise also you all do not take away life from us through flames, exiles, tortures, or wild beasts, with which you rend and drag our bodies, you exonerate us from our skins and bodies, ignorant, and by how much you threaten and proceed tp attack these likeness and our appearances, by this much you free us from our narrow and grievous chains, and you cause us to fly up to the light with all obligations removed.

78.1 Hence, men, refrain from empty questions to block your hopes, and if you do not think anything otherwise than this, you ought to believe yourself rather than the opinions of the revered thing.
78.2 The times, full of dangers, bear down, and deadly forces threaten: let us flee to the health-giving God, and not drive out the reason behind the offered gift. Whenever it is discussed concerning the safety of our spirits and the regard for ourselves, anything also should be done without rationale, as Arrianus approves that which Epictetus had said.
78.3 We hesitate, we dispute and we mistrust that which is said against the fullness of our faith: let us commit ourselves to God, and let not our incredulity show forth among us more than the magnitude of his name and power, lest, while we seek arguments against us, through which the truth seems false, that which we refuse and try, the final day approaches unobserved and we find ourselves in the throat of hostile Death.

**4.36 Censorship Translation**
36.1 And this is not fault enough. Also the personages of the gods are interpolated into farces and farcical plays, and laughter and hilarity is possible to be aroused for the empty spectators, the gods are struck by these jeering jokes: they shout and surge to the theaters, all the audience members make noise with clangs and claps, and, because it is able to be atoned for with no amount of sacrifice, gifts and presents are prepared for the prostitutes and scoffers of the gods, leisure from the public duties, immunity and vacation with crowns.
36.2 And do you dare, after this, to wonder from where these evil things rise, through which mortality is pressed without any intermission, when each thing  the wrapped disgraces
36.3 Because, if some indignation held you for your religious beliefs, you ought rather to have burned these letters, once these books, to have demolished those books, to have destroyed rather these theaters, in which the infamies of divinities are put forth in shameful stories.
36.4 For our scriptures indeed, why do they merit being given to the fires, why do our churches merit to be wildly razed? And in them the highest God is worshipped, peace and pardon are asked for all the magistrates, the armies, the kings, familiar friends, enemies, as yet for those enduring life and for those loosening from the chains of their bodies; in which nothing else is heard unless it is that which makes men, unless that which is gentle, pleasing, pure, chaste, communicators of a friendly affair, and with all whom it strengthens, joined, with the bond of brotherhood.

**4- The Accusation**
1.1 Because I have learned that some, who believe that they know as much as possible through their own intelligence, act crazily, run wild, and speak as if a manifestation of an oracle, say that after the Christians began on this earth, the world fell to ruin, the race of humans was afflicted with manifold evils, and even the gods themselves, dropped their sacred duties by which they were formerly accustomed to watch over our earthly matters, were banished from their regions of the earth.
1.2 I have decided, in accordance with my capacity and moderate ability of speech, to oppose these false accusations of hate and to do away with these complaints, so that either those people do not seem to themselves to have said something great, while they merely utter popular rumors, or if we keep ourselves from such quarrels, they think that their cause has prevailed, having beaten a faulty view, not having been rendered void by the silence of the protectors.
1.3 For I would not refuse that that accusation is most valid, and that we are deserving of the anger afforded us, if in our view, it were proven that we are the reason the world strayed from its laws, the gods were banished to faraway lands, and such tests of human sorrows were brought on this age.
**5- Nīl sub sōle novum**
2.1 Let us therefore inspect the reason behind that opinion, and what is said, and with removal of all desires of fighting, with which the consideration of these matters is accustomed to be obscured and covered up, let us examine what is said is true, with an examination of equal consideration.
2.2 For it will certainly be brought about by the connection of reasonable, logical arguments, that we are not impious, but rather they themselves are plaintiffs discovered worthy of that charge, who consider themselves to be worshippers of the gods and dedicated to the ancient ways.
2.3 And first, we ask with this friendly and calm speech: after the name of Christian began to be in these lands, what unusual was felt, what unseen was endured, what against the directly instituted laws, which is said to be and called nature, occurred?
2.4 Is it possible that those first elements were changed into adverse particles, from which it is said that all matter is composed?
2.5 Is it possible that the construction of this machine and mass of rocks, in which we are all protected and held enclosed, was in some part loosened or dissolved? Is it possible that this rotation of the earth, the original rudder of motion, is dying, and has begun either to crawl more slowly or to be dragged by precipitous whirling?
2.6 Is it possible that tendency of the signs has begun to raise the stars from their westerly parts and to be carried into the east? Is it possible that the sun itself, the leader of the stars, with whose light all things are draped and with whose warmth all things come to life, flared up, became warm, and spoiled its customary system into adverse conditions? Is it possible that the moon ceased to renew itself and to display its old shapes with the rebuilding of new ones?
2.7 Is it possible that the cold, that the warmth, that the tepid, have perished because of the disorder of uneven times? Is it possible that winter began to have long days and night began to call back the latest lights of summer?
2.8 Is it possible that the winds exhaled their final breaths, and after their gales died out, the sky was not packed into the clouds and the dry lands did not become moist with rainfall? Does the earth refuse to accept the seeds it is given or do trees not wish to bloom? Has the taste in edible crops and wines been changed? Is black blood pressed from olives and is light no longer shining, having been extinguished?
2.9 Do the animals, accustomed to the lands, and those living life in the seas not mate, not take in the children from their wombs, not protect them with their behavior and law?
2.10 Finally do men themselves, whom the first and original birth scattered through two habitable coasts of land, not marry with those solemn rites? Do they not produce most sweet swathes of children?
2.11 Do they not conduct public businesses, do they not conduct private and family affairs? Do they not, as it is pleasing to each man, direct their talents and skills through diverse arts and disciplines, and find enjoyment in their eagerness and activity?
2.12 Do they not rule, do they not command, those to whom the lot of such things was given? Do they not become richer daily in honors and powers, rule in debates of the laws, and interpret the laws and rights?
2.13 All other things in which human life is summed up and contained, do they not practice all these things in the tribes of men, following the institutions of their customs?
3.1 Therefore, since these things are so, and not any new thing has broken this succession of events, which separated the everlasting course of affairs, why is it said that a calamity befell the earth after the Christian religion showed itself in the world and uncovered the sacraments of the once concealed truth?
3.2 They say, "But the pestilence, and droughts, wars, scarcity of crops, locusts, mice, and hailstorms and other noxious things, with which human affairs are cursed, the gods bring upon us, irritated at your injustices and offenses"
3.3 If in transparent and requested affairs, that need no defense, it were not stupid to delay longer, I would certainly show, through unwinding former ages, that the evils which you speak of were not unknown, were not unexpected, and after our race earned to be given this title through the @happiness@ of this designation, that these disasters burst forth and had begun to disturb mortal affairs by a variety of crises.
3.4 For if we are the cause, and these plagues were contrived in accordance with our crime, from where did the people of antiquity coin these names of their suffering, from where did they give a name for wars? From what reasoning was antiquity able to designate a word for pestilences or hailstorms, or to create it among their voices, with which speech was set forth? For if these evils are new and come forth from recent offenses, who was able to come forth to form the words for these calamities, which he neither knew nor had learned that it was experienced or practiced by any of his ancestors at any time?
3.5 They say "scarcity of crops and grain tightly hold us."  For were the ancient times and the most archaic ages free from want at any time? Do not these names, with which these evils are assessed, testify and exclaim that no mortal was ever immune to these things?
3.6 And if this affair were difficult to believe, we would be able to discuss by the testimonies of so many authors, how often and which nations experienced a horrid famine and ceased to exist through increasing devastation.
3.7 "Most frequent storms of hail occur and grind away all things."-for do we not see in the ancient letters, stated and composed, also that stony showers often pulverized whole regions?
3.8 "difficult rains make the crops die and create a barrenness in the lands." - for was antiquity immune to this evil, when also we know that massive rivers died with dried mud?
3.9 "diseases and contagions burn inside the race of humans." - run through the writings of the annals, written in a myriad of languages: you will learn that entire races were repeatedly laid waste and were left devoid of inhabitants.
3.10 "each kind of the crops is destroyed and eaten away by locusts and mice." - go through your histories and you will be taught how often a prior age was afflicted by those pest and came to the misery associated with poverty.
3.11 "states waver to the point of danger, caused to tremble by most destructive movements of the earth" - what, did prior times not see cities stolen by enormous rifts, with all of their people, or did they have fortunes secure from this sort of disaster?
5.3 When Helen was snatched by the gods, generals, and other instigators, and was an ominous and calamitous person for the coming times, was this attributed to the crime of our religion?
5.4 When that massive Xerxes allowed the sea onto the lands and crossed the seas, was this caused by wrath against our name?
5.5 When, from the territory of Macedonia, one adolescent appeared and subjugated the kingdoms and peoples of the East through captivity and servitude, did we do this and did we incite the reasons for it?
5.6 When the Romans recently, as if some flowing river, submerged and buried entire nations, did we, evidently, throw the divine beings into this madness?
5.7 But if there is no man who dares to ascribe the things which were done long ago to our times, how are we able to be the originators of the present miseries, when nothing new occurs, but all these things are old and heard of by ancient peoples?
6.1 Although, concerning those wars which you say were stirred up because of hatred of our religion, it is not difficult to confirm that after Christ was heard on this earth, not only did these wars not increase in number, but also they diminished because of the lessening of the greater part of frenzying passion.
6.2 For since a great host of men have learned from his teachings and laws, that evil should not be repaid with evil, that it is more commendable to endure injustice than to inflict it, better to pour out oneself than to pollute our hands and conscience with another's blood, and the thankless world receives this kindness from Christ, through whom the madness of savagery was softened and began to keep hostile hands from the blood of kindred life.

**6- The true source of these evils**
7.1 "But if," they say, "no human affairs (dat of reference?) are inconvenienced by you, from where do these bad things come, by which our miserable existence has long been beset and oppressed?"
:::
8.2 For what if the base matter, which is dispersed through the four elements of things, contains the causes of all these miseries, wrapped in its plans and rules?
*8.3* What if the movements of the stars bring forth these evils in certain signs, regions, times, (lines?) and cause for those subjected to them the difficult times of various crises?
8.4 What if, at appointed times, changes in the state of affairs occur, and as in maritime swells, sometimes favorable tides raise you, but then the prosperous times recede, exchanged for evils?
8.5 What if the ground itself, which we trample under our feet, has this law, that it should breath out most harmful vapors, through which the air itself is corrupted, and both @enacts@ harm to the body and weakens human activities?
8.6 What if - that which is closest to the truth - whatever seems against us is not an evil to the world itself, and judging all things which are made in terms of our conveniences, we accuse the happenings of nature with unsound opinions?
:::
9.1 He says "The sky does not rain, and we struggle from quite a scarcity of food." - For why do you require that the elements serve your needs and, so that you are able to live more easily and conveniently, ought to give themselves to your pleasantries as considerations of the seasons? (obsequia?)
9.2 For what if, in this manner, a man most wanting to sail, laments for a while that there are no winds and the breaths of the sky have gone quiet? Surely in the same way it should not be said that the tranquility of the earth is pernicious, because it denies the wishes of the sailors?
9.3 What if someone, accustomed to tan in the sun, and to dry his body, with similar rationale complains that his serenity is taken away by the recurring clouds? Surely in the same way it should not be said that the clouds cover the sky in a hostile veil, because he is not permitted, @at his pleasure@ , to leisurely tan himself in the rays and to create a reason for drinking?
9.4 All these events, which take place and occur on this mass of rock, are not for our comforts, but must be regarded as the laws and order of nature itself.
10.1 And if anything occurs which favors us or our affairs too little in terms of happy outcomes, it is not immediately considered an evil and to be regarded a destructive thing.
10.2 The world rains or it does not rain: it rains for itself or it does not rain and, what perhaps you do not know, either it heats the excessively wet ground with a drying heat or it tempers a long drought with showers of rain.
*10.3* It creates pestilences, diseases, famines, and other destructive ills: whence is it that you know that it does not remove what is abundant, to establish expenses, in its own way, for overly indulgent choices?
11.1 Should you dare to say: this and that in this world is bad, of which neither the origin or the cause you are able to explain or refute and, because it perhaps impedes your enjoyment of beloved things and other pleasures, would you say that it is a hamful and harsh thing?
11.2 Why therefore? Because the cold is adverse to your limbs and is accustomed to take and constrict the movement of your blood, therefore there should not be winter on this earth? And because you are not able to endure and to deal with the hot sun, should summer be struck from the year and nature again arranged by another route with other laws? (is alia an adverb or adj?)
11.3 Helleborre is a poison to men: should it therefore not grow? The wolf hides in sheepfolds: is it then nature at fault, because it created a beast most dangerous to the wools? The serpent destroys life with its bite: should you speak ill of the origin of things, because it added such savage wonders to all begotten life(?)
*12.1* This endeavor is exceedingly arrogant, because you yourself are not yours, but rather you are in another's possession, to wish to give a condition to more powerful ones, so that what you desire might occur, not that what you have found in these matters is fixed by its ancient structures.
12.2 Therefore if you all wish your complaints to have a place, men, before this is so you should teach us from where or who you are, if the world was brought forth and forged for you, or if you came into it as tenants from another place? (what type of ut clause?)
*12.3* So, since you are not able to say it is yours, and you are not able to explain for whose sake you live under this curvature of the heavens, cease to think that anything concerns you, since these things which occur do not occur (in a distributed manner? equally?) but give back and are rendered for the sum of the whole world.

**7- @The occurrence of the opposite@ must be explained**
13.1 They say "the gods carry out all bad things because of the Christians, and the death of crops is carried out by the deities." - I ask, when you say these things, do you not see that you flagrantly misrepresent us in clear and obvious lies?
13.2 There have been almost 300 years, to some degree more or less (is aliquid an adv here?), since Christians began to be and to be known on earth: were wars constantly occurring during these years, or was barrenness continual, was no peace found in these lands, no time without ceasing where there was cheapness and abundance of things?
13.3 For this first must be proven by him who accuses us, that these calamities have been continuous and unyielding, that never have mortals caught their breath entirely, without any days of rest, as it is said, and they endured the appearances of multiple crises.
14.1 And yet we see that in these intervening years and times innumerable victories have been reported over conquered enemies, the boundaries of the empire have been expanded, and nations with previously unheard names controlled in our power; repeatedly there have been years of the greatest outcomes, and such abundance and cheapness of goods that all trade shuttered to a halt, stricken by the power of the low prices.
14.2 For how was it possible that things were done and the race of humans endured until this time, if the fertility of things did not furnish all things @which use demands for life@?
15.1 But there were some times of necessities - and again these were relieved by abundances; against our consent certain wars were conducted - set right afterwards by victories and successes.
15.2 Why should we say that the gods are just now mindful of our injustices, only to be unmindful again?
*15.3* If, at a time when there is a famine, they are said to be angered, it follows that in a time of abundance they are not angered or intractable; and so the matter is brought down to this, that with playful changes they both put aside and take up their anger, and always restore themselves to the wholesome opinion, now with pardon and even recollection of offenses.

**8- Anger is not compatible with divinity**
17.1 And nevertheless, oh great worshippers and mouthpieces of the gods, why do you declare that those most revered gods feel resentment toward the Christian peoples? Therefore do you not draw your attention to it, do you not see it, how disgraceful, how indecent the emotional follies you attribute to the gods really are?
*17.2* For what else is rage than anger, than fury, than to be carried by a desire of vengeance, and made savage in the clutches of grief of one another, to rave in the numbness of ones chest?
17.3 The great gods know, endure, and feel this, what feral beasts, what wild animals, what deadly water-snakes contain in their poisoned teeth.
*17.4* It is proclaimed by you that you know what shallowness there is in men, what is culpable in earthly life, prevailing in that nature and residing in the strength of constant courage -
17.5 And what therefore inevitably follows, except that flaming sparks burst forth from their eyes, their gasping chest wavers, froth is spills from their mouth and their lips become pale from their burning words?
18.1 But if that is true, and explored and known, that the gods seethe with wrath and emotion of this sort, that they are disturbed by such a feeling, they are not immortal and everlasting and should not be placed, in any estimation, worthy of the status of a divinity.
18.2 For where there is any as it seems to wise men, emotion, there passion must be; where passion is allowed, there emotional commotion is sure to follow; where there is this commotion, there grief and weakness; where there is grief and weakness, there is a place for diminishment and corruption - which two, if they harass, there ruin is close by, a death ending all things and stealing life from all sentient beings.
19.1 Why? Because you present them in this way, that they are not only fickle and hot blooded, but also - that which is agreed to be far removed from the gods - both unfair and unjust, and have absolutely no mind for fairness or restraint?
*19.2* For what is so unjust as to resent some and wound others, to lament about men and destroy harmless crops, to disdain the name of the Christians and to undermine its worshippers with every expense?

**9- The shared suffering of the @pagan@ must be explained**
21.1 Let them bestow upon you favorable health, and bestow adverse and even the worst health upon us. Let them irrigate your fields with favorable rains, and whatever splashes of rain there are, let them steal them from our small fields. Let them arrange your sheep to be multiplied with many offspring, let them bring unlucky sterility on our herds.
21.2 Let them produce full harvest at the farm from your olives and vineyards, but let them prohibit that one drip be pressed from our vines.
21.3 And for the last and final punishment, let them order that crops retain their flavor in your mouth, but in ours that honey be made bitter, that the rivers of olive oil be spoiled, and that the faithless wine suddenly be turned @bitter in the lips of drinker@
*22.1* Since these things themselves testify that they do not occur at all, and it is agreed that life giving gifts do not overflow less for us whatsoever and do not overflow more for you, the desire, which is great, to contend that the gods are hostile and unfriendly to the Christians, whom in most sad and in happy circumstances, you see no difference from you in any reckoning?
22.2 If you allow the truth (verum acting as a noun for once?) to be spoken without any toadyism, these are words, just words; indeed things believed through pretenses, not proven by the finding of some inquiry.
