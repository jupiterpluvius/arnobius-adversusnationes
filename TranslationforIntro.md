**1.39 Translation**
1. O blindness, not long ago I venerated images just made from furnaces, gods made on anvils and from hammers, the bones of elephants, pictures, ribbons on old trees; whenever I had looked at a @slippery@ stone, soiled from the oil of an olive, as if a power were present inside it, I used to worship it, I used to speak to it and I used to request favors from the unfeeling trunk, and those gods themselves, whom I had persuaded to be for me, I used to affix with the grievous complaints, when I believed that they were sticks, stones, and bones or resided in material of this sort.
2. Now, led by such a *teacher* into the ways of truth, I know all *these* things which are, I feel worthy feelings about worthy things, I make no complaint to the divine name, and what and to whom something is owed either for character or personage, I offer it, with unconfused gradations and authorities.
3. So therefore should Christ not be held as a god by us and not otherwise maintained with worship of his godliness, for each who is very able, from whom this long time we both receive such great gifts, living, and we await fuller days when he will have come?

**Jerome's References Translation**
1. Arnobius, a rhetorician, is held in high esteem in Africa, who, while he taught young men in Sicca to make speeches, and as yet was a pagan was compelled to *credulitas* in dreams, and was not granted, by a bishop, the faith which always he had fought against, he composed at night against his former religion most excellent books and together, as if with certain securities of *pietas*, he entered the Church.
2. Arnobius, under Emperor Diocletian, most prosperously taught rhetoric at Sicca in Africa, and wrote books against the pagans, which generally circulate... Firmianus and Lactantius were students of Arnobius... here in extreme old age he was the teacher of Caesar Crispus, son of Constantine, in Gaul...
3. Arnobius is unequalled and great and, were it not for the distribution of his work, obscure.
4. I decide now and then to read Origen, thus because of his instruction, just as Tertullian and Novatus, Arnobius and Apollinarius, and some Church writers, the Greeks and the Latins equally, so that we may choose the good things of theirs, and avoid those things contrary near the sayings of the Apostle Paul: approve all things, which are good, and accept them.
5. Arnobius distributed seven books against the pagans and his disciple Lactantius did the same.

**Persecutions (2.76-78) Translation**
76.1. "Why therefore," he says, "if you all serve the omnipotent God, and believe that he finds concern in your health and wellbeing, why does he allow you all to suffer such persecutions and endure all sorts of punishments and supplications?"
76.2 Let us, conversely, search everywhere, and ask why you, although you worship so many innumerable gods and although you build sacred temples to them, you mold statues of them from gold, you sacrifice flocks of animals, you throw all incense boxes of frankincense on full altars, why do you all not receive exemptions from so many crises and storms, from which daily you all live in many and deadly examples of your fortune?
76.3 Why, I say, do your gods cease to avert so many kinds of diseases and illnesses from you, shipwrecks, downfalls, fires, pestilences, sterility, loss of pledges and confiscation of goods, instances of discord, wars, rivalries, the capturing of cities and enslavements with your status and rights taken away?
76.4 But also God aids us not at all in misfortunes of this sort. The cause is visible and clear. For nothing is promised to us for this life, nor is any aid pledged or granted to us for arrangements of health in this earthly body; indeed we have been taught to think and to deem all threats of fortune, whatever they are, as small, and if at any time some more grave force will have threatened us, which is necessary to achieve an end, to find pleasure in the misfortune and neither to fear nor flee, because more easily we are able to remove the bondages of the body from its chains and to destroy the shadowy blindness.

77.1 And so that which you say is the roughness of persecution is our freedom, not persecution, nor will upheaval inflict punishment, but will lead us to the light of freedom.
77.2 It is as if some brutish and dull man should reckon a man, put in prison, without a departure, never to afflict himself with heavy and burdensome punishments of investigations, unless he attacks the prison itself, he smashes the wood and burns the roof and the wall, he strips, hurls, and destroys the doors and other parts of the place, not knowing, with this done, for him to whom it seemed that he impeded light, it was being given by him, and sinful blindness was being taken away by him: likewise also you all do not take away life from us through flames, exiles, tortures, or wild beasts, with which you rend and drag our bodies, you exonerate us from our skins and bodies, ignorant, and by how much you threaten and proceed tp attack these likeness and our appearances, by this much you free us from our narrow and grievous chains, and you cause us to fly up to the light with all obligations removed.

78.1 Hence, men, refrain from empty questions to block your hopes, and if you do not think anything otherwise than this, you ought to believe yourself rather than the opinions of the revered thing.
78.2 The times, full of dangers, bear down, and deadly forces threaten: let us flee to the health-giving God, and not drive out the reason behind the offered gift. Whenever it is discussed concerning the safety of our spirits and the regard for ourselves, anything also should be done without rationale, as Arrianus approves that which Epictetus had said.
78.3 We hesitate, we dispute and we mistrust that which is said against the fullness of our faith: let us commit ourselves to God, and let not our incredulity show forth among us more than the magnitude of his name and power, lest, while we seek arguments against us, through which the truth seems false, that which we refuse and try, the final day approaches unobserved and we find ourselves in the throat of hostile Death.

**4.36 Censorship Translation**
36.1 And this is not fault enough. Also the personages of the gods are interpolated into farces and farcical plays, and laughter and hilarity is possible to be aroused for the empt spectators,
36.3 Because, if some indignation held you for your religious beliefs, you ought rather to have burned these letters, once these books, to have demolished those books, to have destroyed rather these theaters, in which the infamies of divinities are put forth in shameful stories.
36.4 For our scriptures indeed, why do they merit being given to the fires, why do our churches merit to be wildly razed? And in them the highest God is worshipped, peace and pardon are asked for all the magistrates, the armies, the kings, familiar friends, enemies, as yet for those enduring life and for those loosening from the chains of their bodies; in which nothing else is heard unless it is that which makes men, unless that which is gentle, pleasing, pure, chaste, communicators of a friendly affair, and with all whom it strengthens, joined, with the bond of brotherhood.
