**1.39 Translation**
1. O blindness, not long ago I venerated images just made from furnaces, gods made on anvils and with hammers, the bones of elephants, paintings, ribbons on ancient trees; whenever I had looked at a slippery stone, wet with olive oil, as if a power were present inside it, I used to worship it, I used to speak to it and I used to request favors from the unfeeling trunk, and those gods themselves, whom I had persuaded myself were real, I used to affix with serious slanders, when I believed that they were sticks, stones, and bones or resided in those materials.
2. Now, led by such a *teacher* into the ways of truth, I know all *these* things which are, I feel worthy feelings about worthy things, I make no complaint to the divine name, and what and to whom something is owed each person or head, I offer it, with unconfused gradations and distinctions.
3. So therefore should Christ not be held as a god by us and not otherwise maintained with worship of his godliness, for each who is able, from whom this long time we both receive such wonderful gifts, living, and we await the day when he will come?

**Jerome's References Translation**
1. Arnobius, a rhetorician, is held in high esteem in Africa, who, while he taught young men in Sicca to make speeches, and as yet was a pagan was compelled to *credulitas* in dreams, and was not granted, by a bishop, the faith which always he had fought against, he composed at night against his former religion most excellent books and together, as if with certain pledges, he entered the faith which he had sought.
2. Arnobius, under Emperor Diocletian, most prosperously taught rhetoric at Sicca in Africa, and wrote books against the pagans, which generally circulate... Firmianus and Lactantius were students of Arnobius... here in extreme old age he was the teacher of Caesar Crispus, son of Constantine, in Gaul...
3. Arnobius is uneven and excessive and, were it not for the distribution of his work, obscure.
4. I decide now and then to read Origen, thus because of his instruction, just as Tertullian and Novatus, Arnobius and Apollinarius, and some Church writers, the Greeks and the Latin-speakers equally, so that we may choose the good things of theirs, and avoid certain things, as the apostle Paul says: examine all things, and accept those which are good.
5. Arnobius distributed seven books against the pagans and his disciple Lactantius did the same.

**Persecutions (2.76-78) Translation**
76.1. "Why therefore," he says, "if you all serve the omnipotent God, and believe that he finds concern in your health and wellbeing, why does he allow you all to suffer such persecutions and endure all sorts of punishments and supplications?"
76.2 Let us, conversely, search everywhere, and ask why you, although you worship so many innumerable gods and although you build sacred temples to them, you mold statues of them from gold, you sacrifice flocks of animals, you throw all incense boxes of frankincense on full altars, why do you all not receive exemptions from so many crises and storms, from which daily you all live in many and deadly examples of your fortune?
76.3 Why, I say, do your gods cease to avert so many kinds of diseases and illnesses from you, shipwrecks, downfalls, fires, pestilences, sterility, loss of pledges and confiscation of goods, instances of discord, wars, rivalries, the capturing of cities and enslavements with your status and rights taken away?
76.4 But also God does not aid us in misfortunes of this sort. The reason is visible and clear. For nothing is promised to us in regard to this life, nor is any aid pledged or granted to us for those on earth of health in this sack of flesh; indeed we have been taught to think and to deem all threats of fortune, whatever they are, of little import, and if at any time some more grave force will have threatened us, and this must come to an end, to find pleasure in the misfortune and neither to fear nor flee, because more easily we are able to remove the bondages of the body from its chains and to destroy the shadowy blindness.

77.1 And so that which you say is the roughness of persecution is our freedom, not persecution, nor will upheaval inflict punishment, but will lead us to the light of freedom.
77.2 It is as if some brutish and dull man should reckon a man, put in prison, without a departure, never to afflict himself with heavy and burdensome punishments of investigations, unless he attacks the prison itself, he smashes the wood and burns the roof and the wall, he strips, hurls, and destroys the doors and other parts of the place, not knowing, with this done, for him to whom it seemed that he impeded light, it was being given by him, and sinful blindness was being taken away by him: likewise also you all do not take away life from us through flames, exiles, tortures, or wild beasts, with which you rend and drag our bodies, you exonerate us from our skins and bodies, ignorant, and by how much you threaten and proceed tp attack these likeness and our appearances, by this much you free us from our narrow and grievous chains, and you cause us to fly up to the light with all obligations removed.

78.1 Hence, men, refrain from empty questions to block your hopes, and if you do not think anything otherwise than this, you ought to believe yourself rather than the opinions of the revered thing.
78.2 The times, full of dangers, bear down, and deadly forces threaten: let us flee to the health-giving God, and not drive out the reason behind the offered gift. Whenever it is discussed concerning the safety of our spirits and the regard for ourselves, anything also should be done without rationale, as Arrianus approves that which Epictetus had said.
78.3 We hesitate, we dispute and we mistrust that which is said against the fullness of our faith: let us commit ourselves to God, and let not our incredulity show forth among us more than the magnitude of his name and power, lest, while we seek arguments against us, through which the truth seems false, that which we refuse and try, the final day approaches unobserved and we find ourselves in the throat of hostile Death.

**4.36 Censorship Translation**
36.1 And this is not fault enough. Also the personages of the gods are interpolated into farces and farcical plays, and laughter and hilarity is possible to be aroused for the empty spectators, the gods are struck by these jeering jokes: they shout and surge to the theaters, all the audience members make noise with clangs and claps, and, because it is able to be atoned for with no amount of sacrifice, gifts and presents are prepared for the prostitutes and scoffers of the gods, leisure from the public duties, immunity and vacation with crowns.
36.2 And do you dare, after this, to wonder from where these evil things rise, through which mortality is pressed without any intermission, when each thing  the wrapped disgraces
36.3 Because, if some indignation held you for your religious beliefs, you ought rather to have burned these letters, once these books, to have demolished those books, to have destroyed rather these theaters, in which the infamies of divinities are put forth in shameful stories.
36.4 For our scriptures indeed, why do they merit being given to the fires, why do our churches merit to be wildly razed? And in them the highest God is worshipped, peace and pardon are asked for all the magistrates, the armies, the kings, familiar friends, enemies, as yet for those enduring life and for those loosening from the chains of their bodies; in which nothing else is heard unless it is that which makes men, unless that which is gentle, pleasing, pure, chaste, communicators of a friendly affair, and with all whom it strengthens, joined, with the bond of brotherhood.

**4- The Accusation**
1.1 Because I have learned that some, who believe that they know as much as possible through their own intelligence, act crazily, run wild, and speak as if a manifestation of an oracle, say that after the Christians began on this earth, the world fell to ruin, the race of humans was afflicted with manifold evils, and even the gods themselves, after the solemn duties were abandoned with which they were formerly accustomed to watch over our earthly matters, were banished from their regions of the earth.
1.2 I have decided, in accordance with my capacity and moderate ability of speech, to oppose these false accusations of hate and to do away with these complaints, so that either those people do not seem to themselves to have said something great, while they merely utter popular rumors, or if we keep ourselves from such quarrels, they think that their cause has prevailed, having beaten a faulty view, not having been rendered void by the silence of the protectors.
1.3 For I would not refuse that that accusation is most valid, and that we are deserving of the hostile odium afforded us, if in our view, it were proven that we are the reason the world strayed from its laws, the gods were banished to faraway lands, and such tests of human sorrows were brought on this age.
**5- Nīl sub sōle novum**
2.1 Let us therefore inspect the reason behind that opinion, and that which is similar to it, and with all removal of contentions, pursuits with which the consideration of these matters is accustomed to be obscured and muddied, or that which is said to be true, let us examine with a consideration of both sides.
2.2 For it will certainly be brought about by the connection of reasonable, logical arguments, that we are not more impious, but they themselves are worthy of that charge, who consider themselves to be worshippers of the gods and dedicated to the ancient ways.
2.3 And first, we ask with this friendly and calm speech: after the name of Christian began to be in these lands, what unusual was felt, what unseen was endured, what against the directly instituted laws, which is said to be and called nature, occurred?
2.4 Is it possible that those first elements were changed into adverse particles, from which it is said that all matter is composed?
2.5 Is it possible that the construction of this machine and mass of rocks, in which we are all protected and held enclosed, was in some part loosened or dissolved? Is it possible that this rotation of the earth, the original rudder of motion, is dying, and has begun either to crawl more slowly or to be dragged by precipitous whirling?
2.6 Is it possible that tendency of the signs has begun to raise the stars from their westerly parts and to be carried into the east? Is it possible that the sun itself, the leader of the stars, with whose light all things are draped and with whose warmth all things come to life, flared up, became warm, and spoiled its customary system into adverse conditions? Is it possible that the moon ceased to renew itself and to display its old shapes with the rebuilding of new ones?
2.7 Is it possible that the cold, that the warmth, that the tepid, have perished because of the disorder of uneven times? Is it possible that winter began to have long days and night began to call back the latest lights of summer?
2.8 Is it possible that the winds exhaled their final breaths, and after their gales died out, the sky was not packed into the clouds and the dry lands did not become moist with rainfall? Does the earth refuse to accept the seeds it is given or do trees not wish to bloom? Has the taste in edible crops and wines been changed? Is black blood pressed from olives and is light no longer shining, having been extinguished?
2.9 Do the animals, accustomed to the lands, and those living life in the seas not mate, not take in the children from their wombs, not protect them with their behavior and law?
2.10 Finally do men themselves, whom the first and original birth scattered through two habitable coasts of land, not marry with those solemn rites? Do they not produce most sweet swathes of children?
2.11 Do they not conduct public businesses, do they not conduct private and family affairs? Do they not, as it is pleasing to each man, direct their talents and skills through diverse arts and disciplines, and find enjoyment in their eagerness and activity?
2.12 Do they not rule, do they not command, those to whom the lot of such things was given? Do they not become richer daily in honors and powers, rule in debates of the laws, and interpret the laws and rights?
2.13 All other things in which human life is summed up and contained, do they not practice all these things in the tribes of men, following the institutions of their customs?
3.1
