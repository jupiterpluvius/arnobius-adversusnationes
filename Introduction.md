Arnobius Afer: African identity
  Romanization
  African religion before and after arrival of Christianity


Re-read notes and articles as part of doing that
As I re-read make note of two kinds of references:
annotated list of references that are pure information (primary source- inscription or Tertullian)
  Provides evidence of so and so, give reference of where it was cited to put in context
Make note of footnotes that would point to useful articles

Unity and Diversification of Roman Unification for example
Anywhere that it looks like further investigation is necessary

Roughing out versions of each of the subsections in step 1

No reason to quote a scholar for the assertion of a fact
Things like really good phrasing, conclusions to be challenged or supported

If I find a good map make note of it

Length is however long it takes me

List of interesting topics:
Sicca as a major Christian center- "most Christian"
History of Romanization, creation of Africa Proconsularis
Security creates opportunity for thriving literary scene
Level/degree of Romanization- multicultural identity
Beliefs of Pre-Roman African religion- henotheism, Saturn, rocks, sacrifice, old gods, sacred prostitution
Participation in Persecution
Sources in African Christianity-Tertullian, Minucius Felix, Clement of Alexandria etc.
African style? (McCracken's assertion)

Subdivisions (Think about order):
Romanization
African Religion up until Christianity
Christianity in Africa
    Overall, African Christians had a somewhat different set of values from European Christians of the time. In particular, they valued individual and communal purity, the idea that "mother Church" held the saving sacraments, the truth of prophecy, dreams and visions, and the meaning behind martyrdom and sacrifice. However, just like the indigenous African religion, these were just some of the overarching beliefs of the area. Each community had its unique set of characteristics, which explains the fact that Arnobius agrees with some of these positions but not all of them.
