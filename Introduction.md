  African religion before and after arrival of Christianity


Re-read notes and articles as part of doing that
As I re-read make note of two kinds of references:
annotated list of references that are pure information (primary source- inscription or Tertullian)
  Provides evidence of so and so, give reference of where it was cited to put in context
Make note of footnotes that would point to useful articles

Unity and Diversification of Roman Unification for example
Anywhere that it looks like further investigation is necessary

Subdivisions (Think about order):
Romanization
    The Romans began their dominion over north Africa with the creation of the province of Africa Proconsularis in 146 BCE. When the Romans controlled new territories, they would enact a process which modern historians refer to as "Romanization". This term describes the political and cultural dominance of the Romans over any indigenous peoples, usually through the combining of native ideals with Roman ones. This injection of Roman culture would occur throughout all facets of life, including language, religion, and architecture. In Africa, this took shape under a few different directives and imperial laws. While tribes would ostensibly keep much of their own law under the Romans, the government would manipulate the affairs of these groups by placing a praefectus gentis in charge of recruiting members of the army from the group. Romans would assign tribal lands to groups in order to formally recognize them, which would allow legal interaction between these groups and the government. While some Roman territories became "civilized" easily, many Africans resisted Roman interventions culturally and militarily.
    Overall, Romano-African society was something distinct altogether from its predecessors and other parts of the Empire, exemplified by “outward symbols of civilization (art, architecture, iconography, literature, dedications, etc.) [which] exhibit, each in their own way, a search for accommodation and common meaning between the Roman state and the African society.”  

    At the time of Arnobius, the African population was comprised of African and Punic peoples who had married Romans as well as other immigrant groups. The native African languages of Libyan and Punic remained somewhat common in rural areas, but Latin was the language of commerce as well as scholarly pursuits. [^footnote 2]

Christianity in Africa

    Overall, African Christians had a somewhat different set of values from European Christians of the time. In particular, they valued individual and communal purity, the idea that "mother Church" held the saving sacraments, the truth of prophecy, dreams and visions, and the meaning behind martyrdom and sacrifice.[^footnote1] However, just like the indigenous African religion, these were just some of the overarching beliefs of the area. Each community had its unique set of characteristics, which explains the fact that Arnobius agrees with only some of these ideas. This overarching stereotype of African Christianity may have compelled Jerome's description of Arnobius's conversion, saying that he was led to the faith through dreams. This would be a sensible story for an African Christian- however, Arnobius decries this practice in (INSERT CITATION)

    Even before the time of Arnobius, Tertullian claimed that each city in Africa was majority Christian. [^footnote3] While this may have been an exaggeration,

    Sicca as a major Christian center

    Participation in Persecution

What it means to be African- a multicultural identity (may need to merge with Romanization section- lots of overlap)

    Understanding Arnobius's identity as an African is crucial, because the blend of Roman and African cultures created a distinct background and lens through which Arnobius viewed paganism, Christianity, and society. By the time of Arnobius, there was a sense of pride attached to the national identity of Africans. [^footnote Shaw 527] The fact that Arnobius is referred to as "Afer", a Roman cognomen denoting a relationship to Africa, shows his connection to the culture- his name itself referred to his cultural heritage. Some other famous North Africans are generally referred to by this name, including Terence. This shows the level to which this identity was valued by the inhabitants of Africa. Even those Africans who seemed "as Roman as could be" still retained this ethnic identity.

    Both in spite of and because of Romanization, there arose a strong identity for Africans. Like African religion, many areas and peoples had local claims to which they were devoted. While these localized identities may have been emphasized more before the Roman governance, the encompassing African identity arose due to it. While this may seem counterintuitive, some Africans reacted against Romanization, rather creating a stronger identity for Africans "the social identity of groups is constructed out of circumstances of high-pressure factors-above all, warfare-that link diverse ethnic groups under a new single identity" pg 537. A common identity came about in order to protect Africans against the tide of Romanization. The ethnic infighting among the Africans would not cease, but local claims became less important as a dichotomy of Romans and Africans emerged. On the other hand, many considered themselves both Roman and part of their African ethnic group, creating a blended, multicultural identity.

    Arnobius’s African background also heavily influenced his scholarly pursuits. Although he was Berber, a group indigenous to North Africa, the area was Romanized, meaning he would have spoken and read Latin. Adversus Nationes was based on Arnobius’s understanding of a few Christian works, namely Clement of Alexandria's Protrepticus, Tertullian's Apologeticum, and the Octavius of Minucius Felix . The fact that all three of these men were African shows a level of nationalism and pride for the literary pursuits of his fellow Africans, along with a level of comfort with their writing style. Some scholars go so far as to describe Arnobius’s peculiarities as representative of the African style (though that should not necessarily be viewed as a compliment).
