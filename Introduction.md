Arnobius Afer: African identity
  Romanization
  African religion before and after arrival of Christianity


Re-read notes and articles as part of doing that
As I re-read make note of two kinds of references:
annotated list of references that are pure information (primary source- inscription or Tertullian)
  Provides evidence of so and so, give reference of where it was cited to put in context
Make note of footnotes that would point to useful articles

Unity and Diversification of Roman Unification for example
Anywhere that it looks like further investigation is necessary

Roughing out versions of each of the subsections in step 1

No reason to quote a scholar for the assertion of a fact
Things like really good phrasing, conclusions to be challenged or supported

If I find a good map make note of it

Length is however long it takes me
