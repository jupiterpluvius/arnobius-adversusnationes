come back to this part- the printed text is different from the original one used, so I need to look at this again. This will probably need a note for clarification

[2] The evidence of Jerome
According to Jerome, Arnobius wrote *adversus gentes* to prove his conversion to Christianity: the books were widely read. He is a rhetorician of some renown, but Jerome does not enjoy his style.
