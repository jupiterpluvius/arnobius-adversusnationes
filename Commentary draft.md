[1] Arnobius's Conversion

Arnobius used to blindly follow the pagan traditions, but now clearly sees the truths of the world because of his devotion to Christ.

come back to this part- the printed text is different from the original one used, so I need to look at this again. This will probably need a note for clarification

Vocab list??
Should I put the list with clauses then words, or just the order in which they appear in the passage?

[2] The evidence of Jerome
According to Jerome, Arnobius wrote *adversus gentes* to prove his conversion to Christianity: the books were widely read. He is a rhetorician of some renown, but Jerome does not enjoy his style.

[3] Diocletian's Persecution in the background
2.76
Pagans and Christians alike suffer misfortunes, despite efforts to appease the gods. Arnobius is not dissuaded from his faith by this, saying that God did not promise an easy life to those who follow him, but rather eternal deliverance.
