COMMENTARY

Arnobius's Conversion
1.39
Arnobius used to blindly follow the pagan traditions, but now clearly sees the truths of the world because of his devotion to Christ.
1
caecitas- vocative (not sure if I need to include this)
{siquando conspexeram} temporal clause
{tamquam inesset} clause of comparison
contumeliis? I don't think it requires inclusion because it is means
rerum
2
nomini
gradibus, auctoritatibus

Vocab list??
Should I put the list with clauses then words, or just the order in which they appear in the passage?
