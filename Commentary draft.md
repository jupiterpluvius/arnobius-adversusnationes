[3] Diocletian's Persecution in the background
2.76
Pagans and Christians alike suffer misfortunes, despite efforts to appease the gods. Arnobius is not dissuaded from his faith by this fact, claiming that God did not promise an easy life to those who follow him, but rather eternal deliverance.

@@{Epictētum}- Epictetus was a Greek Stoic philosopher. His teachings were written down and published by his pupil Arrian in his *Discourses* and *Enchiridion*. Epictetus taught that philosophy is a way of life and not just a theoretical discipline. To Epictetus, all external events are beyond our control; we should accept calmly and dispassionately whatever happens. However, individuals are responsible for their own actions, which they can examine and control through rigorous self-discipline.
