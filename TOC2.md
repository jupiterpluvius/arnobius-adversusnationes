- **Defense of the novelty of Christianity**

 - The pagans also adopt novelties: list of ancient laws that are no longer followed 2.67
 - Authority is not appraised in time but divinities
   - Historical and Mythological math: the pagan religion is not older than 2,000 years 2.71
 - Christianity is not new but recently revealed 2.72
   - Likewise, pagans worship new, foreign deities frequently 2.73 (continuation of 2.67- do we want to organize chronlogically or in terms of argument?)

   - Christ was sent when humanity was ready 2.75

 - The reason for the late revelation of Christianity is unknown 2.74
 - God does not have a gender (could possibly fit) 3.8
 - God is transcendent in form (cannot tell if this would be apophatic or cataphatic) 3.12
 - God's shape and qualities are unknown to Christians 3.17-19 (hypocritically says this of pagans in 3.37-38, 3.42)
 - Human error is no excuse, but much is beyond understanding 4.18
