   - Likewise, pagans worship new, foreign deities frequently 2.73 (continuation of 2.67- do we want to organize chronlogically or in terms of argument?)

	- Christ’s Miracles 1.45-47
	- Miracles and Christianity have historical evidence 1.54-56

 - Christ's teachings make him worthy of worship 1.38

 - God does not have a gender (could possibly fit) 3.8
 - God is transcendent in form (cannot tell if this would be apophatic or cataphatic) 3.12
 - God's shape and qualities are unknown to Christians 3.17-19 (hypocritically says this of pagans in 3.37-38, 3.42)
