- **Defense of the novelty of Christianity (2.66-2.75)**
 - Ancient accounts of religion have more fictions than recent ones 1.57
 - Old does not mean better 2.66
   - Men seek that which is more valuable and pleasing, not what is traditional 2.66
 - The pagans also adopt novelties: list of ancient laws that are no longer followed 2.67
 - Authority is not appraised in time but divinities
   - Historical and Mythological math: the pagan religion is not older than 2,000 years 2.71
 - Christianity is not new but recently revealed 2.72
   - Likewise, pagans worship new, foreign deities frequently 2.73 (continuation of 2.67- do we want to organize chronlogically or in terms of argument?)
 - The reason for the late revelation of Christianity is unknown (apophaticism) 2.74 (really a continuation of 2.72)
   - Christ was sent when humanity was ready 2.75

	- Christ’s Miracles 1.45-47
	- Miracles and Christianity have historical evidence 1.54-56


- **Defense of Jesus's humanity (if combined with miracles, could be defense of the dual natures of Christ (being both fully human and fully divine))**
  - Christians worship a human being: does this make pagan gods jealous? 1.36
   - Hypocrisy: Pagans deified many humans 1.37
 - Christ's teachings make him worthy of worship 1.38
 - Christ's violent death does not undermine his authority 1.40
   - Many who are worshipped by pagans died in similar ways as Christ 1.41 (last sentence of 1.39 could be added to this section)

 - The reason for the late revelation of Christianity is unknown 2.74
 - God does not have a gender (could possibly fit) 3.8
 - God is transcendent in form (cannot tell if this would be apophatic or cataphatic) 3.12
 - God's shape and qualities are unknown to Christians 3.17-19 (hypocritically says this of pagans in 3.37-38, 3.42)
 - Human error is no excuse, but much is beyond understanding 4.18
 - Reason the Christians do not build temples (God's desires are beyond understanding) 6.1-first two paragraphs of 6.3
 - How can idols be true likenesses? 6.10
 - Who are the true gods? 7.2
 - Summary of all opinions on God and gods 7.35 [49]

	 - are the gods only sometimes indignant about the Christians?
 - The gods inflict calamities on all, not just Christians 1.21-22

	- Appearance
	- Behavior
	- The absurdity of allegory (and euphemism)
	- ?
- The uselessness of temples
