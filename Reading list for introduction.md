# Shaw. "Cult and Belief in Punic and Roman Africa" in Cambridge History of Religions in the Ancient World.
Notes
Maghrib's location between barren desert and populated sea create both connectivity and isolation- promotes development of outside ideas once entrenched pg 235
Created a strange array of religions before Christianity's arrival pg 235
"every environmental niche as small as a village or a valley came to have its own spirits, deities, rituals, and festivals. The practices and beliefs were so integrated into the life of each ethnic people, village, cultural or occupational group that they formed an almost out-of-mind part of daily routine" pg 235
Christianity brought strange ideals that would disrupt village life pg 236
pragmatic henotheism took root in Africa pg 236
Oral communication- early religion is lost pg 237
detailed knowledge of local African practices is lacking for pre-Roman times pg 238
localization of cults pg 239
Punics brought gods like Ba'al Hammon, henotheistic, semitic pg 240
Sacrifice at the heart of practice- including children and infants pg 240
100 child sacrifices annually- central, permanent, normal part of Punic cult pg 241-2
Tertullian's testimony is faulty but perhaps true pg 242
Human blood sacrifice central to worship of Ba'al and his Roman continuator, the omnipotent god Saturn- Romans found substitutes for children pg 242
After 146 BCE Greek and Roman deities mixed and associated with aspects of others pg 244
Romans had an impact on official ritual as imperial state, provincial administration, and local municipal government pg 244
large-scale deliberate importing of official cult began in the Augustan age pg 244
Romans built public buildings in the Province, places where Christians would later have to make public sacrifices pg 245
core "western" provinces of Proconsularis, Numidia, and the Mauretanias the Saturn cult was overarching pg 247
Certain regions had Jupiter, Isis, Serapis, Mercury, and Silvanus cults pg 247
"Saturn and Caelestis were living continuators of Ba’al and Tinnit...the cult of Saturn was the pervasive and dominant African practice of the Roman imperial age." pg 248
"the worship of the emperors gradually added to the legitima-tion of their rule in the provinces. Despite its apparent signiﬁ cance for the central government, imperial ideology, and the identity of local elites, the general importance of the imperial cult or emperor worship is probably less than is perhaps suggested by the modern attention lavished upon it" pg 250
core institutions of emperor worship were almost unknown in Africa pg 251
except for concilium provinciae, which was made to reform and regulate this pg 251
“Romanizing” towns ( res publicae ) whose elites, seeking to mimic the forms of Roman public life, developed their local forms of official cult" pg 252
elites liked Dionysus pg 252
micro-cults and personal belief were also common, with superstition rampant pg 254
"So profuse and fragmented and mixed were the deities and their various presences, and so fragmentary is the evidence about them, that in most cases all we  can  see is this effect" pg 258
Two sides say that cults were resistance to Romanization or were the modulation to mediate the cultural difference pg 258
subjugation, adaptation, resistance, accommodation, creolization, power negotiations are all possible tensions between African religion and Romanization pg 259

# Tilley. "Roman Africa" in Cambridge History of Christianity vol 1.
Notes
Lit. evidence comes from Tertullian, Minucius Felix, Cyprian, Commodian, and others (Arnobius and Lactantius are outside the scope of this work) pg 381
no evidence of buildings set aside as churches before 300 CE pg 382
Carthage oligarchy got Romans involved pg 382
Severans became first African emperors pg 383
Many other redistributions occurred, like under Diocletian, supporting Romanization and administration of the frontiers pg 383
Romanization was strongest in coastal and military areas, but not all cities had Roman mores or govt pg 383
Some Romanization of architecture and names occurred, but only when it was to the advantage of the Africans to use it pg 384
Punic religion survived in cities assimilated to Roman cults pg 385
Child sacrifice was used to avert catastrophe pg 385
Semitic roots and lack of founding apostle means no certainty pg 386
Jewish communities around Carthage may have been the foundation of Christianity in Africa, and had many of the same practices pg 386
There were a great number of bishops, would discuss but decide for their own people what the doctrines would be pg 387
Christians in Africa persecuted intermittently from 180-305 pg 387
"In assessing the strength and effects of persecution, one must recognize that not all Christians in every area of the empire were persecuted at the same time in the same way. Even imperial edicts designed to promote empire-wide uniformity depended upon local enforcement which may have been sporadic or non-existent in one place while sustained and severe elsewhere. The ambient ideal of human sacriﬁce, whether in war or at the altar, supported the Christian notion of the acceptability of offering one’s life in ﬁdelity, but it should be noted that no motifs of human sacriﬁce directly color martyrdom narratives" pg 388
Had many martyrdom stories, like proconsul treating nicely but Christians would not worship the emperor pg 388
Septimius Severus made Christianity illegal pg 388
Persecuted during the 250s by Decius during time of trouble to ensure pax deorum. Many Christians were exiled or killed pg 389
"In 256 Valerian issued an edict requiring higher-ranking clergy to sacriﬁce on behalf of the emperor, proscribing Christian assemblies, conﬁscating property and forbidding Christians to have their own cemeteries" pg 390
Cyprian was executed in 258 for his status pg 390
many martyrs and confessors were held in high esteem leading up to Diocletian pg 391
Christians rationalized their fidelity with Apologetic works- wrote absurdity of traditional cults pg 392
"Christians claimed to be plain-living and morally upright. Their lack of ease with the ambient culture played out in paradoxical ways. Tertullian’s expressed disdain for philosophy and dialectic (Spect. 18, An. 3) and Arnobius’ rejection of rhetoric (Adv. nat. 1.59) are summed up in Tertullian’s famous aphorism, ‘What is there in common between Athens and Jerusalem, between academe and church, between heretics and Christians?’ (Praescr. 7), yet even this is expressed in the best classical style" pg 392
local practices sprung up due to low numbers and high distances pg 393
Most Christians in Africa believed that God provided revelations through dreams pg 393
Issues: could Church reconcile those who sinned after baptism? caused divisions pg 394
African Christianity was literalistic and legalistic- solve problems pg 395
Women valued and had a role as leaders pg 395
Tended towards literal and strict interpretations of scripture and morality, unity and collegiality are important pg 396

Notes w/page references/quotes
Strong appeal to identity for Africans "being African had become an identity" pg 527
ethnic group of Afri were original identity, found inland of Carthage, and came to be a term for the continental mass pg 527-8
Roman Army had cohorts of Africans pg 528
Uncertain when Afer became a generalized term- used as cognomen for Terentius pg 528
While many had local claims, there was a strong identity of Africans pg 530
This did not stop ethnic infighting among Africans, like for Apuleius pg 531
Numidian farmers vs Gaetulian pastoralists became stereotype pg 531
Many considered themselves both Roman and part of their African ethnic group pg 531
Romans would assign tribal lands to groups to formally recognize them, allowing interaction between groups and the state pg 533
The govt would manipulate the affairs of these groups by placing a praefectus gentis in charge of army recruiting in the group pg 534
tribes would keep much of their own law under the Romans pg 535
Kinship units: gens, domus, and familia hierarchy pg 535
Word "Moor" came from Roman consideration of people of the Maghrib pg 537
"the social identity of groups is constructed out of circumstances of high-pressure factors-above all, warfare-that link diverse ethnic groups under a new single identity" pg 537
ethnic identity was present even for those who "were just as citified, educated, and Roman as could be" pg 537
Common identities are created to use as protection where solidarity matters pg 538
Common language shows a common identity for Africans pg 538

Afterward most useful info (w/evidence)
The identity of Africans and its History
Why these groups form
Romanized people still had their original ethnic identity
Possible that the influence of Romans took away smaller distinctions and gave a sense of larger identity

Notes for follow-up concerning Arnobius
Strong appeal to identity present for Africans as a whole, common language and identity. This identity was present even for heavily Romanized people
